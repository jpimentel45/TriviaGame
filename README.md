# My Trivia game has random questions about the 90â€™s and 2000. You will have to click on the start button to initiate game. Once the game starts, you will have 15 seconds to make a selection. There will be a counter for every right, wrong, or unanswered question. At the end you will be shown a screen with the total score, and and an option to restart the game once you press the restart button.

#Basic html was used, with minor css, JavaScript used for logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.
